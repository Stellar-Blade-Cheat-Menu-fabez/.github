# Stellar Blade Cheat Menu ⚔️💫

**Stellar Blade Cheat Menu** drops a slick in-game overlay that turns Eve into a post-apocalyptic demi-goddess. Within seconds you can freeze green **Stamina**, flood the blue **Beta Energy** bar, and auto-bank Skill Points—so every perfect-parry counter feels like a cinematic flex. The menu injects cleanly into the new PC build without alt-tab gymnastics and follows dynamic pointers each patch.

## Overview

Shift Up’s sci-fi slasher blends stylish combos with souls-like boss pressure. Every swing drains Stamina and Beta juice, leaving careless pilots wide open. Ranked lobbies use server checks, but offline drills and custom rooms run client-side, making memory edits totally viable for combo labs and highlight reels.
The Cheat Menu attaches on launch, pings fresh pointers, and spam-writes values in < 1 ms loops—faster than the game can bleed them.

## Feature Breakdown 🛠️

* **Infinite Stamina** – sprint, dash, and juggle without ever seeing red.
* **Perma Beta Energy** – chain burst skills back-to-back for stylish nukes.
* **Max Skill Points** – auto-fill SP meter and unlock entire trees on the spot.
* **Wider Parry Window** – script extends perfect-parry frames for God Hand reflexes.
* **Boss-Timer Freeze** – halt rage-phase clocks to finish fights your way.
* **Cosmetic Unlocker** – flip one toggle and every outfit hits the wardrobe.
* **Hotkey Builder** – bind cheats to any key or pad button; profiles auto-load.
* **Safe Attach Mode** – low-rate writes mimic human rhythm, trimming crash risk during cut-scenes.

## Why Our Cheat Menu Obliterates the Competition 💥

Many trainers still chase shooter clichés like ammo, ignoring Blade’s stamina-and-beta loop. Ours laser-locks the exact bars that dictate combo flow, letting you flood bosses with uninterrupted Burst chains. Auto pointer scanning self-heals when Shift Up tweaks memory maps, slashing downtime after hotfixes. Overlay design means you tweak stats mid-dodge—no more blind alt-tabs.
